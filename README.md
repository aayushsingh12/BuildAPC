# BuildAPC
Building a custom PC is challenging due to the vast number of components and the need to ensure compatibility between them. Users often visit multiple sources and manually cross-check specifications, leading to errors and wasted time. This project aims to create a centralized database application where users can select PC parts from a large dataset, with the system automatically ensuring all chosen components are fully compatible.
